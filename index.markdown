<p>Beowulf:  the  first  surviving  epic  written  in  the  English  language.  The  single existing  copy  of  the  manuscript  dated  from  the  late  tenth  century,  although some scholars believe it dates from the first part of the eleventh century. It is found in a large volume that features stories involving mythical creatures and people. There is no knowledge about the poet as well as the day of the poem’s composition. Beowulf is short, with 3182 verses, yet it is the longest as well as the richest of  Old  English  poems.  The  first  great  work  of  English  literature  is  not  set  in Britain; Beowulf  opens  with  the  mysterious  figure  of  Scyld,  founder  of  the Scylding  dynasty  of  Denmark,  who  would  have  lived  c.400,  before  England existed. Beowulf is about King of the Danes, Hrothgar and about a brave young man, Beowulf, from Southern Sweden, who goes to help him. The King’s great hall, called Heorot, is visited at night by a terrible creature, Grendel, which lives in the  lake  and  comes  to  kill  and  eat  Hrothgar’s  men. One  night  Beowulf  waits secretly  for  Grendel  and  attacks  it  and  in  a  fierce  fight  pulls  its  arm  off.  It manages  to  reach  the  lake,  but  dies  there.  Then  its  mother  comes  to  the  hall and  the  attacks  begin. Beowulf  follows  her  to  the  lake  and  kills  her  there.  </p>
